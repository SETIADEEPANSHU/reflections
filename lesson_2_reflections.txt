when we initialise a repository it shows that you have created an empty repository with no files traced .we create repository so as to keep track of files and their different versions.
staging area is different from repository and working directory in the way that the staging area is a place where you add things to be committed whereas working directory simply stores all things and repository is a collection of commits
