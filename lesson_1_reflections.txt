It actually saves a lot of time as you don't have to manually scroll out the whole pages and see what went wrong when you edited the file
As when we have access to entire history we can easily access the older files for comparing with new files
pros of manually creating commit is that whenever u want to create a commit according to logic u can create it.cons of manually creating commit is sometimes we forget to create commit
saving linking files commonly is better as it allows to treat files comonly whereas in google docs as these files are treated separately it does not benefit at all
git log command give the whole versions saved on commit andgit diff compares two commit
we can restore to any previous version at any time using git checkout
i want to use git for just comparing different versions of my website changes that i will make and restore to them
